                    The best way to avoid a DCRat infection is to be cautious when receiving suspicious emails, including
                    not downloading attached files or visiting embedded links. Itâ€™s also important to only trusted and
                    verified software sourced from official sources. Also, never install illegal (cracked) software or
                    third-party updates as they are commonly used to distribute malware such as DCRat. Finally, use advanced
                    cybersecurity products and ensure they are up to date. Following these precautions can significantly
                    reduce the risk of a DCRat infection.
