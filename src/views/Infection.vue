                        RATs, in general, can target a wide range of victims, including individuals, small businesses, large
                        enterprises, government entities, activists, and more. They can be used for purposes such as data
                        theft,
                        surveillance, espionage, and remote control of compromised systems. The exact victims of any RAT,
                        including Dark
                        Crystal RAT, would depend on the intentions and targeting choices of the threat actors using the
                        malware.
